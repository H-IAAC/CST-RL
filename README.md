CST-RL is a framework for building assynchronous RL agents as part of a larger cognitive architecture through the [Cognitive Systems Toolkit (CST)](https://cst.fee.unicamp.br/). Its focus is largely on solving the structural and communication challenges of an assynchrounous RL agent rather than the specifics of the algorithms implemented. As such, while a couple of benchmark algorithms are implemented directly in Java, the plan is to implement more state-of-the-art algorithms through the use of external libraries.

Moreover, this repository uses the open-source game engine [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) to build complex environments through the use of the [CST-Godot framework](https://godotengine.org/).

This repository is divided in the following sections

- [Python](#python)
- [Godot](#godot)
- [CST-RL](#cst-rl)

# Python

Includes a simple Python script that uses [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) and [Pyplot](https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/introductory/pyplot.html) to generate graphs from CSV files. This is used to generate graphs of cummulative reward over time of different algorithms from the CSV files generated by CST-RL. 

# Godot

The Godot project used as environment for the RL algorithm. It communicates with CST through the use of HTTP requests.

# CST-RL

The framework itself. Here, it runs as a web API that communicates with a Godot environment, receiving percepts and returning actions.
